Machine Learning Society Training Resources

The Machine Learning Society wanted an easier way to bring new members up to speed on the latest techniques. This project was created in response.

This is a collection of jupyter notebooks and learning resources aimed at those that already have a good idea of computer science and linear algebra. To run the notebook, clone the repository and run one of the notebooks in jupyter or just view them on github.
